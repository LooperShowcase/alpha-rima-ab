    <h1>Apple 1980-1990</h1>
    <p>
      aplee 1980-1990  A critical moment in the company's history <br>came in December 1979 <br>when Jobs 
      and several Apple employees, including humanâ€“computer interface expert Jef Raskin, visited Xerox
       PARC in to see a demonstration of the Xerox Alto, a computer using a graphical user interface.<br>
        Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the 
        option to buy 100,000[38] shares (5.6 million split-adjusted shares as of March 30,<br> 2019)[23] 
        of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.[39] After the demonstration, Jobs was immediately 
        convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface, and development of a
         GUI began for the Apple Lisa, named after Jobs's daughter.[40][41]<br>

      The Lisa division would be plagued by infighting, and in 1982 Jobs was pushed off the project. <br>
      The Lisa launched in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, 
      but was a commercial failure due to its high price and limited software titles.[42]<br>
      
      Jobs, angered by being pushed off the Lisa team, took over the company's Macintosh division.<br>
       Wozniak and Raskin had envisioned the Macintosh as low-cost-computer with a text-based 
       interface like the Apple II, but a plane crash in 1981 forced Wozniak to step back from the
        project. Jobs quickly redefined the Macintosh as a graphical system that would be cheaper
         than the Lisa, undercutting his former division.[43] Jobs was also hostile to the Apple II 
         division, which at the time, generated most of the company's revenue.[44]
