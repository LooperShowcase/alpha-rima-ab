      1976-1980 Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1,<br />
      1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business
      partnership.[7][10] The company's first product was the Apple I,<br />
      a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[11][12] To finance
      its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW
      Bus, for a few hundred dollars,<br />
      and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for US$500 (equivalent to $2,381 in
      2021).[13] Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew
      Computer Club in July 1976.<br />
      [14][15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic
      textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as
      a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for
      US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,175 in 2021).[17][18][19][20][21]: 180 
      Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in
      the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked
      "repeating digits".[22] Apple Computer, Inc.<br />
